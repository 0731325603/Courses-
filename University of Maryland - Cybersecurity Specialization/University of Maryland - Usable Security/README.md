## Course Description

This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, and apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.

## The Curriculum

### Week 1
- Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction: users, usability, tasks, and cognitive models
